My name is Nikhil Shagrithaya. I am a second year Masters student at IIT Kanpur, working under [Prof. Rajat Mittal](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rmittal/). I am mainly interested in theoretical computer science and computational complexity.

Previously, I was really into working with memory safe languages, such as [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and even contributed to [Servo](https://servo.org/), an experimental web engine written using Rust.

My master's thesis can be found [here](../thesis.pdf).
